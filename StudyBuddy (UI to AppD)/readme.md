## Objective for Contributors  
The goal for contributors in this project is to **convert the existing UI design into a fully functional Flutter application**. The app’s primary focus is on creating an interactive, responsive, and scalable app that mirrors the design while ensuring smooth user experience and efficient code practices.  

## Current Design  
The app’s UI includes the following screens:  
1. **Intro Screen**: The splash screen welcoming users to StudyBuddy.  
2. **Home Page**: Displays folders, recommended sets, and subjects for browsing.  
3. **Featured Page**: Showcases books and questions users can explore.  
4. **Search Page**: A search functionality for textbooks, sets, and questions.  
5. **Create New Page**: Allows users to create new sets or folders.  
6. **Set Creation Page**: Interface for creating flashcards.  
7. **Library Page**: Displays a categorized view of the user’s stored study content.  
8. **Profile Page**: Includes account details, stats, and trophies.

## Examples for Contributors  
To inspire contributors, the following features and functionalities could be implemented:  
- **Interactive Animations**: Add animations for buttons, transitions, and loading states.  
- **Dynamic Components**: Create widgets for reusable elements like cards, lists, and headers.  
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the app adapts well to various screen sizes and orientations.  
- **State Management**: Integrate state management solutions.  

> These examples are starting points, but contributors are encouraged to bring their creativity to the project.  

## Requirements for Contributors  

- **Recreate the UI in Flutter:**  
  - Design the app’s front end to match the provided UI design with utmost precision, maintaining the gradients, typography, and layout consistency.  

- **Add Functionality:**  
  - Implement basic navigation across pages.  
  - Add interactive elements like button presses, field inputs, and real-time feedback.  

- **Micro-Interactions:**  
  - Use Flutter animations and widgets like `Hero`, `AnimatedContainer`, or `Lottie` for smooth transitions and engaging interactions.  

- **Prototyping and Code Organization:**  
  - Ensure detailed prototyping to confirm user flows align with the UI/UX goals.  
  - Follow clean code practices, modular widgets, and structured directories for scalability.  

- **Maintain Design Consistency:**  
  - Adhere to the provided color styles and themes in the design file.  
  - Use reusable **components and variants** in Flutter for uniformity and efficiency.  

- **Backend Integration (Optional):**  
  - Set up placeholders for API or database integration to store and retrieve user data.  
  - Use a mock data structure for demonstration purposes if backend isn’t implemented yet.  


## Guidelines  
- All contributions must strictly use **Flutter** as the framework for development.  
- Prioritize responsive design to ensure compatibility with mobile and tablet devices.  
- Maintain performance efficiency, avoiding unnecessary re-renders or laggy interactions.  
- Code submissions should include documentation and comments for clarity and review purposes.

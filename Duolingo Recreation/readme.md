# Duolingo UI Recreation Project  

**Project Maintainers:** [Khushie Leishangthem](https://github.com/Khushie134) and [Shriya S](https://github.com/soctopus2327)

## Description  
This project focuses on recreating the UI of the popular language-learning app **Duolingo** using Flutter. The aim is to replicate its engaging design, vibrant interface, and clean navigation. Contributors will gain valuable experience in creating complex, real-world UI designs and translating them into responsive Flutter applications.  

## Objective for Contributors  
The main objective is to **recreate the essential pages of Duolingo’s UI** with a high degree of precision. Contributors should focus on both the visual aspects and the functional layout, ensuring the final app is responsive and adheres to clean coding standards.

## Main Pages to Recreate  

### 1. **Onboarding/Welcome Screens**  
- Interactive pages introducing users to the app.
- Features: Multi-screen onboarding flow with illustrations, animations, and call-to-action buttons.

### 2. **Home Page (Learning Dashboard)**  
- Displays daily lessons, streaks, progress bars, and current activities.  
- Includes navigation to lessons, rewards, and practice sections.

### 3. **Lesson Page**  
- Dynamic question-based layouts with interactive options (e.g., multiple choice, typing answers, drag-and-drop).

### 4. **Leaderboard Page**  
- Displays user rankings in a league system.  
- Includes progress indicators, points earned, and badges.  

### 5. **Profile Page**  
- Shows user stats, achievements, streak count, and custom profile settings.  

### 6. **Shop Page**  
- A store for purchasing in-app items like streak freezes, hearts, or power-ups.  
- Uses a virtual currency system with a clear, interactive layout.  

### 7. **Achievements/Badges Page**  
- Displays the badges and trophies earned by the user.
- Features: Categorized sections for tracking achievements and goals.

## Requirements for Contributors  

### **UI Recreation Guidelines**  
- Recreate the listed pages to match Duolingo’s UI as closely as possible.  
- Maintain consistency in **colors**, **typography**, and **layout**.  
- Replicate animations and transitions using Flutter widgets.  

### **Design Consistency**  
- **Colors**: Use the Duolingo green (#58CC02) and other official colors as provided in the reference material.  
- **Icons**: Recreate or use placeholders for custom icons if needed.  

### **Components and Variants**  
- Utilize reusable components for elements like buttons, cards, and progress bars to maintain scalability.  
- Make use of **variants** for components such as different types of lessons or badges.  

### **Prototyping and Functionality**  
- Implement detailed prototyping for transitions, animations, and interactions.  
- Ensure full navigation between pages using Flutter’s routing system.  

### **Features to Implement (Optional)**  
- Basic state management (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc) for handling UI updates.  
- Placeholder/mock data for lessons, progress, and user stats.  
- Dynamic elements like leaderboards and progress bars should update based on mock data.

## Guidelines for Submissions  

- **Code Structure**: Maintain clean and modular code with well-organized directories.  
- **Documentation**: Provide comments for key sections of the code to enhance readability.  
- **Performance**: Ensure smooth navigation and avoid excessive re-renders.  
- **Git Practices**: Use clear commit messages and create separate branches for each feature.

# Design & Code Challenges

This repository contains a series of projects where the task is to design and implement a single screen of a mobile application using Figma and Flutter. Each project focuses on different UI elements and features, and your goal is to build a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing interface that works seamlessly across devices.

## Design Instructions

For each project, you will first design the screen in **Figma** and then code it out in **Flutter**. Here are the general design guidelines for all projects:

1. **Design a single screen** that adheres to the functional requirements specified in the project’s problem statement.
2. Use the **Figma** design tool to create the screen layout. Ensure your design is clean, modern, and aligned with the specified theme (e.g., Modern, Classic, Vibrant, etc.).
3. Pay attention to **spacing, alignment**, and consistency in fonts, colors, and button styles.
4. Make sure all **interactive elements** (buttons, carousels, sliders) are clearly visible and easily tappable.
5. Ensure your design is **responsive**, meaning it should look great on both smaller and larger screen sizes.
6. Add **interaction states** (e.g., hover, active) for interactive elements like buttons or carousel items.


## Implementation Instructions (Flutter)

After designing the UI in Figma, you'll need to implement the screen using **Flutter**. Here are the general steps for implementing the UI:

1. **Set up your Flutter project** by creating a new Flutter app or using the starter files provided.
2. **Use Flutter widgets** to implement the screen layout, such as `Container`, `Column`, `Row`, `ListView`, `Column`, and so on.
3. For any interactive elements like carousels or buttons, use Flutter-specific widgets:
   - **Carousel:** Use the `CarouselSlider` widget to create image carousels.
   - **Buttons:** Use the `ElevatedButton`, `TextButton`, or `IconButton` widgets for call-to-action buttons.
4. Ensure that the screen **adjusts properly to different screen sizes** (e.g., mobile and tablet).
5. Implement **animations and transitions** for elements like carousels, button clicks, and page transitions, as per the design.
6. **Manage assets** like images efficiently, using appropriate caching and performance optimization techniques.


## Deliverables

For each project, the following deliverables are expected:

1. **Figma Design File:**  
   Submit the Figma design file (or a link to it) with annotations, detailing all UI elements and interactions.
   
2. **Flutter Code:**  
   Submit the full Flutter project via a GitHub repository. The code should be well-organized and commented. Make sure to include a `README.md` that explains your approach to implementing the screen.
   
3. **Screenshots:**  
   Include at least one screenshot of the **Figma design** and one of the **Flutter implementation** (either the app running in an emulator or on a device).
   
4. **Approach Description:**  
   Provide a brief explanation of your approach in the repository’s README. Describe how you implemented the design, the choices you made for widget selection, layout organization, and any issues you encountered during the implementation.


## Contribution Guidelines

1. Each Design & Code Challenge will have a `README.md` with specific instructions and specifications for that challenge.
2. Go through the challenges and find a challenge that you have interest in.
3. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
4. Complete the design and implementation for the screen.
5. Test your changes locally to make sure everything works as expected.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository.
7. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository.
